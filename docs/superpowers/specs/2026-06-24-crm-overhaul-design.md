# CRM Overhaul — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-06-24
**Status:** ✅ Complete — all 9 phases shipped & merged to `master` (2026-06-27). Phases 1–4 via PRs through #12; Phases 5–9 follow (Phase 9 → PR #18).
**Specs paired:** `docs/backend-spec/RepairOS-dev-spec/modules/01-crm.md`,
`docs/frontend-spec/RepairOS-frontend-spec/modules/01-crm-ui.md`

## Goal

Bring the CRM **frontend + navigation** up to the spec. The CRM backend is essentially
complete (leads convert/status/quote, customers merge/timeline, communications, tasks
complete, segments members/bulk-whatsapp all exist). This overhaul surfaces hidden
capabilities in the nav, adds a read-only **Overview hub**, and closes the
leads / customer-profile / segments / mobile gaps.

Net-new backend work is deliberately small and concentrated: the CRM Overview aggregation
endpoint (Phase 1), a leads date-range filter (Phase 2), a cross-CRM activity list and a
cross-lead quotes list (Phases 5–6, both thin endpoints over existing data), and one new
campaign-tracking model (Phase 8). Everything else reuses existing APIs.

The **target CRM menu** is: **Overview · Customers · Leads · Tasks · Segments · Activity ·
Quotes · Campaigns** (with a Calendar view toggle on Tasks).

Work is split into **nine independently-shippable phases**, each its own implementation plan
and PR, sequenced 1 → 9 — mirroring the proven Repair Overhaul pattern. Each phase that adds a
new page also adds its own nav leaf, so the menu never contains a dead link.

## Current state (baseline)

- **Nav (CRM group):** only **Customers** and **Leads** are surfaced.
- **Leads** `/leads`: kanban + list, search, **source** filter, drag-to-advance.
- **Customers** `/customers` + profile `/customers/[id]`: tabs = Repair · Timeline · Tasks ·
  Financial. Merge dialog, tag input, log-communication sheet present.
- **Tasks** `/tasks`: page exists but is **not in the CRM nav**.
- **Segments** `/settings/segments`: page exists but is buried under Settings, **not in CRM nav**.

### Verified dependencies
- `LeadViewSet.get_queryset` already supports `search`, `status`, `assigned_to`, `shop_id`
  filters — but **no date-range filter**.
- `pos/views.py` and `amc/views.py` already filter their list endpoints by `customer_id`.
- Frontend `posApi.listSales(...)` and `amcApi.listContracts(...)` exist; the profile Repair
  tab already uses the same pattern via `repairApi.listJobs({ customer_id })`.

## Phase 1 — Nav restructure + CRM Overview hub

*The only phase with backend work.*

### Nav
- `frontend/src/components/shared/AppShell.tsx` `NAV_ITEMS`: CRM group becomes
  **Overview · Customers · Leads · Tasks · Segments**.
  - Overview → `/crm`, gate `crm.customers.view` (read-only hub).
  - Tasks → `/tasks` (existing page), gate `crm.tasks.manage`.
  - Segments → `/crm/segments` (new home, see Phase 4), gate `crm.segments.manage`.
- Surfaces Tasks and Segments, which already exist but are unreachable from the CRM nav today.

### Backend — `GET /api/crm/overview/`
- Service-layer aggregation in `apps/crm/services.py`, shop-scoped, **no N+1** (a handful of
  aggregate queries), mirroring the Repair `overview` endpoint.
- Returns:
  - `pipeline`: lead counts by status (new/contacted/interested/quoted/converted/lost).
  - `tasks`: `due_today` count, `overdue` count.
  - `recent_conversions`: leads converted in the last 30 days (count + small list).
  - `new_customers`: count created in the last 30 days.
  - `needs_attention`: overdue tasks + unassigned `new` leads (small lists for the hub).
- DRF `APIView` (read-only) + serializer + `permission_classes`; pytest coverage
  (happy path + shop isolation + empty-tenant).

### Frontend — `/crm` page
- KPI tiles (pipeline totals, tasks due/overdue, new customers, recent conversions),
  a pipeline-by-status bar, and a "needs attention" list.
- Skeleton, empty, and error states; tiles/list deep-link into Leads / Tasks / Customers.
- React Query key `['crm','overview', shopFilter]`.

---

## Phase 2 — Leads filters + re-open verification

### Frontend `/leads`
- Add **assigned_to** filter (backend already supports it) — a user `Select`.
- Add **date-range** filter (created_at `date_from` / `date_to`).
- Render active filters as removable chips alongside the existing source filter; applies to
  both kanban (per-column queries) and list views via the shared `baseFilters`.

### Backend `LeadViewSet.get_queryset`
- Add `date_from` / `date_to` filtering on `created_at` (inclusive range) + a unit test.

### Lead mark-lost / convert bug fixes (scope correction — discovered 2026-06-25)
The original premise ("backend already restores `status_before_lost`; just a frontend check")
was **wrong**. Investigation found the leads mark-lost and convert features are broken
end-to-end, with 16 failing tests on the branch:
- **Mark-lost field mismatch:** the frontend (and tests) send `reason`, but `LeadStatusSerializer`
  defines `lost_reason` and the view reads `lost_reason` → the reason arrives empty → every
  `→ lost` transition is rejected with 422. **Fix:** serializer/view accept `reason`.
- **Convert response shape:** the view returns `{"customer_id": ...}` but the frontend
  `convertLead` is typed `apiPost<Customer>` and tests expect the full customer (`id`, `phone`).
  **Fix:** return `CustomerSerializer(customer).data`.
- **Stale frontend tests (5):** `crm.test.ts` asserts the *old* contract (no `lost` transitions,
  no `lost` column) while the code is spec-correct. **Fix:** update the tests to the spec
  contract (lost reachable from every active stage; `lost` is a kanban column; 6 stages).

### Lead re-open
- After the mark-lost fix, verify re-opening a lost lead moves the board card to its **exact
  prior column** (`status_before_lost`) via the existing card "Re-open" action, per
  `01-crm-ui.md` §10 — with a Vitest assertion.

### Leads filters
- Add **assigned_to** (users from `settingsApi.listUsers`) and **date-range** (`date_from` /
  `date_to` on `created_at`) filters, with removable active-filter chips, alongside the existing
  source filter. Backend already supports `assigned_to`; add the date-range filter to
  `LeadViewSet.get_queryset`.

---

## Phase 3 — Customer profile: Sales + AMC tabs

### Frontend `/customers/[id]`
- Add a **Sales** tab — `posApi.listSales({ customer_id: id })`.
- Add an **AMC** tab — `amcApi.listContracts({ customer_id: id })`.
- Each is a lazy-loaded `DataTable` with its own skeleton / empty / error state, following the
  existing Repair-history tab pattern.
- Final tab order: **Repair · Sales · AMC · Timeline · Tasks · Financial** — matching
  `01-crm.md` §4.2.
- If `SaleFilters` / the contract filter type lack `customer_id`, add it (trivial type change;
  the backends already honor the param).

---

## Phase 4 — Segments → CRM + builder + bulk-WhatsApp

### Route move
- `/settings/segments` → `/crm/segments`. Leave a **redirect stub** at the old path (same
  approach used for the Fault Templates relocation). Remove the Settings nav entry for Segments.

### SegmentBuilder
- A rule editor over the `filter_rules` JSONB for **dynamic** segments: supported keys
  `tags`, `min_total_billed`, `customer_type`, `city`. **Static** segments remain an explicit
  member list. Reuses existing `/segments/` CRUD and `/segments/{id}/members/`.

### Bulk-WhatsApp
- Action calling the existing `POST /segments/{id}/bulk-whatsapp/`.
- Show the recipient count **with opt-out excluded**, surfaced to the user before send
  (`01-crm.md` §4.3; acceptance: "bulk WhatsApp respects opt-out").

---

## Phase 5 — Activity feed (cross-CRM communication timeline)

A CRM-wide chronological feed of every communication (call / WhatsApp / visit / email / SMS /
note), the read-only companion to per-profile timelines.

### Backend `CommunicationLogViewSet.get_queryset`
- Add **shop scoping** and a stable `order_by("-logged_at")` (today the list has neither),
  plus `type` and date-range (`date_from` / `date_to`) filters. Cursor pagination already
  applied. Add tests for scoping + filters.

### Frontend `/crm/activity`
- New nav leaf (gate `crm.communications.log`). Chronological list reusing the
  `EntityTimeline` pattern, filterable by type + date, with skeleton / empty / error states.
  Rows deep-link to the related customer or lead.

---

## Phase 6 — Quotes worklist

A cross-lead view of quotes sent to prospects (the `LeadQuote` data currently only reachable
per-lead via `/leads/{id}/quotes/`).

### Backend
- Add a cross-lead list endpoint `GET /api/crm/quotes/` (shop-scoped, `select_related` lead +
  `sent_by`, ordered `-created_at`, filter by lead status / date). Reuses `LeadQuoteSerializer`.
  Tests for scoping + filters.

### Frontend `/crm/quotes`
- New nav leaf (gate `crm.leads.view`). `DataTable` worklist: lead name, amount, sent date,
  sent_by, lead status. Row links to the lead. Skeleton / empty / error states.

---

## Phase 7 — Tasks Calendar view

- **Frontend only**, over the existing `/tasks` API. Add a **list ↔ calendar** view toggle on
  the Tasks page (no new nav leaf). Calendar/agenda renders tasks by `due_date` (+ `due_time`),
  colored by priority/status; clicking a day or task opens the existing `TaskComposer`.
- No backend change; `/tasks` already returns due dates and supports filtering.

---

## Phase 8 — Campaigns (bulk-WhatsApp history)

Elevates segment bulk-send into a tracked **Campaigns** feature (today `bulk-whatsapp` is
fire-and-forget with no record).

### Backend
- New `Campaign` model (tenant DB, soft-delete): `name`, `segment_id`, `template`, `status`
  (draft / sending / sent / failed), `recipient_count`, `excluded_optout_count`, `sent_at`,
  `created_by`. Reversible migration.
- `POST /api/crm/campaigns/` creates + triggers send via the existing bulk-WhatsApp service;
  `GET /api/crm/campaigns/` lists history; `GET /api/crm/campaigns/{id}/` detail. Send stays
  **manual** (no scheduling). Tests for create/list + opt-out exclusion counting.

### Frontend `/crm/campaigns`
- New nav leaf (gate `crm.segments.manage`). List of past campaigns (name, segment, recipients,
  excluded opt-outs, status, sent date) + a "New campaign" flow (pick segment → template →
  preview recipient count with opt-out excluded → send). Skeleton / empty / error states.

---

## Phase 9 — Mobile affordances

- `tel:` (click-to-call) and `wa.me` (click-to-WhatsApp) links on phone numbers across
  `LeadCard`, the customer list, and `CustomerProfileHeader`.
- Quick **"log call"**: after tapping a number, offer to open the existing
  `LogCommunicationSheet` prefilled with `type=call` — no new component.

---

## Cross-cutting requirements

- **Testing:** every touched backend endpoint gets pytest coverage; every new/changed page
  gets Vitest tests and a clean `tsc --noEmit` (project rule: tests before merge).
- **Permissions:** nav leaves and actions gate on the **real seeded permissions**
  (`crm.tasks.manage`, `crm.segments.manage`, `crm.customers.view`, etc.) — verified against
  the seed, not the spec's wording.
- **Phasing:** each phase is an independent plan + PR; sequence 1 → 9. Backend work is confined
  to Phases 1 (overview endpoint), 2 (date filter), 5 (activity scoping), 6 (quotes list), and
  8 (campaign model); Phases 3, 4, 7, 9 are frontend-only.
- **No N+1:** Overview and any list changes use `select_related` / `prefetch_related` /
  aggregates.

## Non-goals

- No changes to the lead state machine, merge logic, or denormalized counters (backend already
  complete and tested).
- No new WhatsApp **templates** — bulk send / campaigns reuse existing templates.
- GSTIN hard-block vs. soft-warning (OQ-09) stays as-is — out of scope.
- No campaign **scheduling / automation** or A/B testing — Campaigns (Phase 8) tracks history
  for **manual** sends only.
- No changes to the Repair / POS / AMC modules beyond consuming their existing
  `customer_id`-filtered list endpoints.

## Risks / notes

- **Route move (Phase 4)** — grep for any hardcoded link to `/settings/segments` before
  finalizing; the redirect stub covers external entry points.
- **Overview endpoint cost** — keep it to aggregate queries; it is read-on-load, so guard
  against per-row queries on the needs-attention lists.
- **Re-open board behavior (Phase 2)** — the only place spec acceptance has historically been
  ambiguous; assert the exact-prior-column behavior explicitly in tests.

## Verification (per phase)

```bash
# Backend (phases touching it)
cd backend
python manage.py makemigrations crm --check --dry-run    # if models/filters change
python -m pytest apps/crm/tests/ --no-cov 2>&1 | tail -12

# Frontend
cd frontend
npx vitest run <changed test files> 2>&1 | tail -15
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep "error TS" || echo "OK no errors"
```
